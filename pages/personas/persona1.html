            <h3>Back Story</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lives with parents and one older brother in a single-family home.</li>
                <li>She is currently studying programming at university and is preparing for an upcoming midterm exam.</li>
                <li>She balances her studies with a part-time job and enjoys interactive learning environments.</li>
                <li>Julie wants to succeed in her programming course, but she sometimes finds complex concepts like recursion challenging.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Motivations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>lie is motivated to pass her programming midterm and improve her understanding of topics like object-oriented programming and recursion.</li>
                <li>She appreciates platforms that offer a combination of self-paced study materials and collaborative tools to help her prepare.</li>
                <li>Interactive learning, such as coding challenges and group study sessions, keeps her engaged and enhances her problem-solving skills.</li>
                <li>She also enjoys connecting with peers and tutors to clarify difficult concepts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Frustrations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Julie gets overwhelmed when preparing for exams, especially when struggling with specific topics like recursion.</li>
                <li>She sometimes finds it difficult to balance her study time with her part-time job.</li>
                <li>She wishes there were more interactive ways to break down complex programming concepts.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Quote</h3>
            <blockquote>“I love solving coding problems, especially when I can see instant feedback. It really helps me learn. But sometimes, recursion drives me crazy! I need to go over it a few times to really get it.” - Julie</blockquote>

            <h3>Ideal Experience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Julie would love a study experience that combines hands-on practice, real-time feedback, and personalized support.</li>
                <li>She enjoys interactive platforms that offer coding challenges, group study options, and access to tutors.</li>
                <li>She suggested that flexibility in choosing study sessions for organizing them according to her personalised schedule would afford her order and eliminate tension.</li>
            </ul>
